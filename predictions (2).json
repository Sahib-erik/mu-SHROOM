Hypothesis:  A Graphics Address Redirection Table (GART) is not exactly the same as an Input-Output (I/O) Memory Management Unit (MMU), but they do share some similarities in the sense that they both deal with memory mapping and addressing.\n\nA GART is a data structure used by graphics processing units (GPUs) to translate or map the virtual addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses in video memory.
